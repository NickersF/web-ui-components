# web-ui-components
 A collection of web UI components in HTML CSS and JS

## The purpose of this project
The goal of this project is to establish a consistent basis for styling
common HTML components and create more complex components using native
browser technologies. The components are designed to be generic enough to
use with common front-end frameworks. However, the focus is for these web
components to be used as .NET Blazor UI components.
